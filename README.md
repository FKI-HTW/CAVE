# CAVE

CAVE is a Unity Package that can enable most Unity projects to run in the virtual environment CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment).
The CAVE uses steoreoscopic projections surrounding the user to create a perspective view. This package uses the Windows Kinect SDK
to track the user with a Kinect v2 and Nintendo Switch JoyCons.

Download the package through the <strong>Window > Package Manager</strong> in the Unity Editor with <strong>Add package from git URL...</strong>.
Using the URL <strong>https://github.com/FKI-HTW/CAVE.git#upm</strong> for the newest version, or <strong>https://github.com/FKI-HTW/CAVE.git#VERSION_TAG</strong> for a specific one. The available version tags can be found in <a href="https://github.com/FKI-HTW/CAVE/tags">Tags</a>.

Through the Package Manager an optional sample can be downloaded which contains a prefab, which defines an example implementation and usage of a complete CAVE.
